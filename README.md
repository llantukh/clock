As per usual, I had no idea where to start with this project. I got some help from a classmate and that got the ball rolling. I was able to get through the clock function without too much trouble...there was a lot of trouble, but I got through it. Then I got stuck on the second div trying to get the hex digits to change. That took several hours and when I finally got it, I felt so ridiculous that it took so long because it was not that difficult. Now I have been stuck on trying to get the colors to change on the hex div for probably three hours. And again I am sure it will be the same as the digits...right in my face and I'm not looking in the right place.
